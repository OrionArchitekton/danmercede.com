Canonical personal site for Dan Mercede.

## Purpose

This site serves as the **canonical reference point** for:

- Professional positioning

It is intentionally structured to be:

- **danmercede.info** — Identity verification & disambiguation  
- **danmercede.online** — Living signal surface / working log  

Product and platform sites (e.g., Cosmocrat, Orion Apex Capital) are maintained separately.
